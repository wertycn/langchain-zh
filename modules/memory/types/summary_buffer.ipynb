    "`ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` combines the last two ideas. It keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, but rather than just completely flushing old interactions it compiles them into a summary and uses both. Unlike the previous implementation though, it uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions.\n",
