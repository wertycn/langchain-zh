How To Guides
====================================


Utils
-----

There are a lot of different utilities that LangChain provides integrations for
These guides go over how to use them.
The utilities here are all utilities that make it easier to work with documents.

`Text Splitters <./examples/textsplitter.html>`_: A walkthrough of how to split large documents up into smaller, more manageable pieces of text.

`VectorStores <./examples/vectorstores.html>`_: A walkthrough of the vectorstore abstraction that LangChain supports.

`Embeddings <./examples/embeddings.html>`_: A walkthrough of embedding functionalities, and different types of embeddings, that LangChain supports.

`HyDE <./examples/hyde.html>`_: How to use Hypothetical Document Embeddings, a novel way of constructing embeddings for document retrieval systems.
