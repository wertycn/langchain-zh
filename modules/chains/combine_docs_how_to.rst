CombineDocuments Chains
-----------------------

A chain is made up of links, which can be either primitives or other chains.
Primitives can be either `prompts <../prompts.html>`_, `llms <../llms.html>`_, `utils <../utils.html>`_, or other chains.
The examples here are all end-to-end chains for working with documents.
