       "\"\\nIn this speech, the speaker addresses the American people and their allies, discussing the recent aggression of Russia's Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. The speaker outlines the actions taken by the United States and its allies to hold Putin accountable, including economic sanctions, cutting off access to technology, and seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs. The speaker also announces the closing of American airspace to Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Together with our allies, the United States is providing military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, and has mobilized forces to protect NATO countries. The speaker also announces the release of 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world, with the United States releasing 30 million barrels from its own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The speaker emphasizes that the United States and its allies will defend every inch of NATO territory and that Putin will pay a high price for his aggression. The speaker also acknowledges the hardships faced by the American people due to the pandemic and the American Rescue Plan, which has provided immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans, helped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance.
