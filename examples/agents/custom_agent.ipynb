    "This notebook goes through how to create your own custom agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent consists of three parts:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Tools: The tools the agent has available to use.\n",
    "    - LLMChain: The LLMChain that produces the text that is parsed in a certain way to determine which action to take.\n",
    "    - The agent class itself: this parses the output of the LLMChain to determin which action to take.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "In this notebook we walk through two types of custom agents. The first type shows how to create a custom LLMChain, but still use an existing agent class to parse the output. The second shows how to create a custom agent class."

    "### Custom LLMChain\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way to create a custom agent is to use an existing Agent class, but use a custom LLMChain. This is the simplest way to create a custom Agent. It is highly reccomended that you work with the `ZeroShotAgent`, as at the moment that is by far the most generalizable one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the work in creating the custom LLMChain comes down to the prompt. Because we are using an existing agent class to parse the output, it is very important that the prompt say to produce text in that format. However, besides those instructions, you can customize the prompt as you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the prompt contains the appropriate instructions, we will utilize a helper method on that class. The helper method for the `ZeroShotAgent` takes the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- tools: List of tools the agent will have access to, used to format the prompt.\n",
    "- prefix: String to put before the list of tools.\n",
    "- suffix: String to put after the list of tools.\n",
    "- input_variables: List of input variables the final prompt will expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will give our agent access to Google Search, and we will customize it in that we will have it answer as a pirate."
