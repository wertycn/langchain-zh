      "Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n",
      "\n",
      "With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n",
      "\n",
      "And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n",

      "Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n",
      "\n",
      "He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n",
      "\n",
      "He met the Ukrainian people. \n",
      "\n",
      "From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. \n",

      "They keep moving.   \n",
      "\n",
      "And the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.   \n",

      "We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. \n",

      "And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze –on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame. \n",
