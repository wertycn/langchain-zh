    "This notebook goes over adding memory to an Agent. Before going through this notebook, please walkthrough the following notebooks, as this will build on top of both of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Adding memory to an LLM Chain](adding_memory.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Custom Agents](../agents/custom_agent.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to add a memory to an agent we are going to the the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We are going to create an LLMChain with memory.\n",
    "2. We are going to use that LLMChain to create a custom Agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to create a simple custom Agent that has access to a search tool and utilizes the `ConversationBufferMemory` class."
